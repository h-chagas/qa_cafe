This is a Java JDBC project created by Hugo Cidral das Chagas

Initial instructions:

-- Store your mySQL password in a safe mode -- <br>
1 - Create a .gitignore file, writing the following file to be ignored by Git: Passcode.java; <br>
2 - Create a stardard class (do not mark the public static void main method) and name it as Passcode.java;  <br>
3 - Open the file/class above, create a public static String variable named as mySqlPassword and asign your mySQL password in it; <br>
4 - The getConnection() method already has the myPass variable passed as parameter. Therefore, your connection with your mySQL workbench will be done in a safe mode. <br><br>
