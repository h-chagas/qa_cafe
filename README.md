This is a Java JDBC project created by Hugo Cidral das Chagas

Initial instructions:

-- Store your mySQL password in a safe mode --
1 - Create a .gitignore file, writing the following file to be ignored by Git: Passcode.java;
2 - Create a stardard class (do not mark the public static void main method) and name it as Passcode.java; 
3 - Open the file/class above, create a public static String variable named as mySqlPassword and asign your mySQL password in it;
4 - The getConnection() method already has the myPass variable passed as parameter. Therefore, your connection with your mySQL workbench will be done in a safe mode.
